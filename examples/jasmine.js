// JASMINEJS: HOW beforeEach AND afterEach WORKS
// In this file I am showing in which order different jasmine functions executes
// To see output for this file: run in your commandline with globally installed protractor:
// protractor --specs examples/jasmine.js 
// Or you can see example output at the end of file

// just class to see results in with correct counter. plz ignore
